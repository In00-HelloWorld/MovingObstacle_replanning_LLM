Description:

{agent_text}

Constraints:
1. Each Crazyflie battery starts at {problem.battery_start:.1f}%.

3. Each battery must always remain above {problem.battery_floor:.1f}%.
4. Charging is allowed only within {problem.charge_radius:.2f} m of either charging station.
5. Charging rate is {problem.charge_rate:.1f}% per second.
6. Each Crazyflie must pass within {problem.visit_radius:.2f} m of every assigned target.
7. Each Crazyflie must finish within {problem.final_radius:.2f} m of its final goal.
8. Max velocity: {problem.max_velocity:.1f} m/s.
9. Max acceleration: {problem.max_acceleration:.1f} m/s^2.
10. Max jerk: {problem.max_jerk:.1f} m/s^3 for smooth quadrotor-feasible turns.
11. Max snap: {problem.max_snap:.1f} m/s^4 and max curvature: {problem.max_curvature:.1f} 1/m.
12. Max attitude rate: {problem.max_attitude_rate_deg_s:.1f} deg/s in the execution model.
13. Every path segment must avoid all obstacle boxes with {problem.obstacle_clearance:.2f} m clearance.
14. The two Crazyflies must stay at least {problem.min_agent_separation:.2f} m apart.
15. Mission should be feasible within the requested mission time {problem.target_time:.1f} seconds.
